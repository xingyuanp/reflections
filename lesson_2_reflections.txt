What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When initializing a repository, a hidden file .git is created to hold the 
	meta information which is needed to keep track of the commit history of 
	this repository. Without initializing, we don't have a git repository and
	we only have a regular directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area contains some files from the working directory. Those
	files' changes will be tracked and can be commited. The repository is a
	special directory that contain a special hidden file .git. We can turn a 
	working directory into a git repository by using git init.
