When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to make a backup copy on GitHub, or maybe I push using different
    computers at different places, for example.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want more control on when to pull and what to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    I need to make forks if I need to copy a repository from one place on
    GitHub to another place on GitHub. I need to make clones if I need to copy
    a repository from GitHub to my local computer, or from one place on my
    computer to another place on the same computer. I can make a new branch if
    I need to try out some features while maintaining the original branch
    unchanged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
